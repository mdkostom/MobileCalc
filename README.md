# Task 6 - Add equation support for your calculator

## Requirement:<br>
The calculator so far is good only for 2 numbers. Please add equation support - i.e. 5+6/2 = 8. The history must still record the equation and its result as previously.

## Results

Had a lot of trial and error with this one. Either = didn't work, then second calculation symbol didn't go through, results were wrong or * and / were not being taken as priority over + and -<br>
Eventually got it working as intended. Even brushed up on .0 not being inclued:<br>
