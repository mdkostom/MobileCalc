# Task 3 - Basic calculator logic

## Requirement:<br>
Please write the logic to the calculator that will support basic operations (+-*/) with 2 real numbers.<br>
Please be mindful of the MVC pattern and don't write logic into the UI classes.

- [calculator_controller.dart](https://github.com/mdkostom/MobileCalc/blob/Task-3-Basic-calculator-logic/lib/calculator_controller.dart) - Applies logic, making it possible to enter numbers, add, substract, divide and multiply as well including decimals

Added Dependencies for [pubspec.yaml:](https://github.com/mdkostom/MobileCalc/blob/Task-3-Basic-calculator-logic/pubspec.yaml)
- rxdart - "rxdart: 0.27.1"
