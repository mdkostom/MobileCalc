# Task 2 - Basic calculator UI

## Requirement:<br>
Please train your UI skills by developing a simple calculator UI. No need for logic right now, that's for a next assignment. You know how a calculator app should look like, so just give it a try ;)

## Results

Created 3 dart files in [lib:](https://github.com/mdkostom/MobileCalc/tree/Task-2-Basic-calculator-UI/lib)
- [main.dart](https://github.com/mdkostom/MobileCalc/blob/Task-2-Basic-calculator-UI/lib/main.dart) - Responsible for starting the app
- [calculator_app.dart](https://github.com/mdkostom/MobileCalc/blob/Task-2-Basic-calculator-UI/lib/calculator_app.dart) - Defines the MyApp class
- [calculator_screen.dart](https://github.com/mdkostom/MobileCalc/blob/Task-2-Basic-calculator-UI/lib/calculator_screen.dart) - Contains the Calculator widget

Clean cyan color UI with ElevatedButton's to make it easier to see where to press. No logic yet.
